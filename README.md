# Shape Factory

Engage in an entertaining activity where you can craft a collection of circles and rectangles, each adorned with your chosen color. <br>

Upon clicking the "Add" button, a fresh div element is dynamically generated, styled, and then added to the storage area. Note that the storage has a capacity of 24 shapes.<br>

Clicking on any shape triggers the display of its shape type (circle or rectangle) along with its corresponding color in a message box.<br>

This small web app is designed to train dynamical creation of HTML elements and use of classes.
